The road map and vision for these open source repositories

This is a living document and will be updated periodicly.

My goal in creating these repositories is to unify development of tools and applications for Burn and Burn-like events.  

First and foremost, we need a unified authentication system.  It probably goes without saying that there are a ton of different solutions already developed for this.  Personally, I believe KeyCloak or Gluu might be the answer... but I want to source others opinions.

My vision is for users to have a centralized "Burner Profile" that will carry across to all regionals.  A person's burner profile would then be linked to a plethora of useful information for particpants and event organizers.  Authorized sources could send us verfied information that would then link to a user's public burner profile.  How many events has a user been verified at?  How many volunteer shifts have they shown up to, how many have they missed?  What camps is this user a part of?  What art projects is this user a part of?  We could publicly display high-level information, and give users control over what granular information they want to keep private.  Additionally, if possible, we should intigrate with existing tools built by the community.  For example, the "Dreams Platform" seems to be a pretty solid way of managing art projects and grants.

Not only can we aliaviate the burdens placed on the event coordinators and leads, we can standardize the processes for particpants.
